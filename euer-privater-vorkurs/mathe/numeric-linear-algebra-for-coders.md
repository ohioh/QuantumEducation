# numeric linear algebra for Coders

"This course is focused on the question: **How do we do matrix computations with acceptable speed and acceptable accuracy?**

This course was taught in the [University of San Francisco's Masters of Science in Analytics](https://www.usfca.edu/arts-sciences/graduate-programs/analytics) program, summer 2017 (for graduate students studying to become data scientists). The course is taught in Python with Jupyter Notebooks, using libraries such as Scikit-Learn and Numpy for most lessons, as well as Numba (a library that compiles Python to C for faster performance) and PyTorch (an alternative to Numpy for the GPU) in a few lessons.

Accompanying the notebooks is a [playlist of lecture videos, available on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtmWHNX-gukIc92m1K0P6bIOnZb-mg0hY). If you are ever confused by a lecture or it goes too quickly, check out the beginning of the next video, where I review concepts from the previous lecture, often explaining things from a new perspective or with different illustrations, and answer questions." fast.ai
