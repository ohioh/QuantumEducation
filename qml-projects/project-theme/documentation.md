1. [Quantum circuits](https://pennylane.readthedocs.io/en/stable/introduction/circuits.html) shows how PennyLane unifies and simplifies the process of programming quantum circuits with trainable parameters.
2. [Gradients and training](https://pennylane.readthedocs.io/en/stable/introduction/interfaces.html) introduces how PennyLane is used with different optimization libraries to optimize quantum circuits or hybrid computations.
3. [Quantum operations](https://pennylane.readthedocs.io/en/stable/introduction/operations.html) outlines the various quantum circuit building blocks provided in PennyLane.
4. [Measurements](https://pennylane.readthedocs.io/en/stable/introduction/measurements.html) presents the different options available to measure the output of quantum circuits.
5. [Templates](https://pennylane.readthedocs.io/en/stable/introduction/templates.html) gives an overview of different larger-scale composable layers for building quantum algorithms.
6. [Optimizers](https://pennylane.readthedocs.io/en/stable/introduction/optimizers.html) details the built-in tools for optimizing and training quantum computing and quantum machine learning circuits.
7. [Configuration](https://pennylane.readthedocs.io/en/stable/introduction/configuration.html) provides details about how to customize PennyLane and provide credentials for quantum hardware access.
